 *
 *  The permission system aims to allow a general-purpose implementation for
 *  all common hardware register usages. This includes:
 *  - Trivial Cases: Read, Write, Read & Write
 *
 *  - Read & Write accesses that route to different values/functions of a chip.
 *    (e.g. serial communication, where read/write corresponds to RX/TX)
 *  - Read to clear, write to clear. This does not directly affect the access,
 *    but can be used to implement a software shadow register for flags
 *    (ORing the read value into a shadow register instead of overwriting).
 *  - Registers with default values that are not known (e.g. Factory configuration
 *    values that should not be overwritten by default).

 * The dirty bit will only ever be set at runtime, so we keep the easily
 * readable lower nibble.
